# Day 1 - Numbers, Arithmetic, and Printing to the Console

# Basic numbers : mostly integers and floats
# The print function is a built-in function
# Developing a good coding style is very important
# Every piece of code we’ve written so far is an expression
# We can use multiple operators
# Just like in normal mathematics, we can use parentheses to group operations
# Simple arithmetic operators (+, -, /, and *)

"""Exercises

Now that we’ve been through the material for this post, here are a few exercises so that you can practice:

    1. Print your age to the console.
    2. Calculate and print the number of days, weeks, and months in 27 years. Don’t worry
    about leap years!
    3. Calculate and print the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units. You can be as accurate as
    you like with the value of p """

# 1 - Print your age to the console
print(31)

# 2 - Calculate and print the number of days, weeks, and months in 27 years
print("In 27 years there are :", 27 * 12, "months")
print("In 27 years there are :", 27 * 52, "weeks")
print("In 27 years there are :", 27 * 365, "days")

# 3 - Calculate and print the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units. You can be as accurate as you like with the
# value of pi
print("Aria of a cicle with radius 5 is :", 5 ** 2 * 3.1415)
