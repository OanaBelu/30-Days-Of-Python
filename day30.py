"""Project

For the graduation project we're going to be building the classic video game Snake using a third party library c
alled pygame.

Today's project is particularly large so there are two project posts for today.

The first is going to be a project preparation post which will walk you through everything you need to know about
pygame. The second will contain a walkthrough for the entire project, and will also contain the project brief."""
